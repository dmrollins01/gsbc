  <h2>History</h2>  
    <p>With a desire an a belief in the promises of God, 28 members exhibted faith and perseverance to secure the charter from the First Baptist Church of Louisville (now Walnut Street Baptist Church) to create a new congregation.  Originally named Second African American Baptist Church, the name was later changed to Green Street Baptist Church and memnbership grew to over 1100 by 1874.  Through God's grace and provisions, the church was able to purchase property, organize for worship, manage its administration and resolve internal conflicts.</p> 
        
        <p>Green Street has been instrumental in the seed planting of other congregations: Forest Baptist, Hill Street Baptist, and First Baptist Church, Anchorage. As early as 1869, Green Street was a member of the General Association of Kentucky Baptists and was instrumental in the creation of Simmons Bible College.</p>
    

    <p> Green Street has only had eight pastors during her 171-year history:  Rev. George W. Wells, Elder Richard Sneathen, Rev. Daniel Gaddie, Rev. Henry W. Johns, Rev. Jesse V. Bottoms, Rev. Tyrone P. Jones, III, and our present pastor, Rev. Carl. J. Jones.  With God as their leader and these ministers as His under-shepherds, Green Street has worked to develop ministries which have helped spread the gospel and develop strong Christian brothers and sisters.</p>
