             <p>
              Our mission is to go and make disciples of all nations,                     baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and                 of the Holy Spirit, and teach them to obey everything that                 Jesus has commanded.

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
            To be a Christ-centered, Holy Spirit-filled, fellowship of 
            born-again believers seeking and submitting to the perfect will             of God as revealed in the Bible, and working together to bring             the unsaved to Christ.

      <h3>Meet Our Pastor</h3>
        <p>
        Our pastor is Rev. Carl Jones. He was installed as our 8th Pastor           on Sept 1, 1991. He has a heart for missions and has labored to             spread the love of Jesus. His great desire is for God to grant him         what the apostle Paul prayed for in Colossians 1:9-11(CEV): That           God will show him everything he wants him to do; grant him all the         wisdom and understanding that The Holy Spirit gives; help him live         a life that honors the Lord; to please Him by doing good deeds;             that He will come to know God even better and that His glorious             power will make him patient and strong enough to endure anything so         that he will be truly happy.
